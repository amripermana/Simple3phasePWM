Simple STM32 3 Phase PWM Generator with variabel frequency
- This example code run on STM32 Blackpill
- This example code using PWM with DMA 
- using Timer 1 -> CH1, CH2, CH3, CH1_N, CH2_N, CH3_N
- Frequency of PWM can be adjusted by editting TIM1->ARR Value on the loop
- The output of the signal is 3 phase PWM signals with 120 degre phase shift and also its inverse signals
